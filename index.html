                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! I’m Isaac, a versatile IT professional and aspiring Data Analyst with expertise in network administration, hardware support, and application troubleshooting. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to support and manage diverse IT environments, from remote healthcare solutions to enterprise-grade infrastructure. In my current role as a Device Engineer, I serve as a critical link between technology and patient care, ensuring that hardware operates seamlessly and securely. With strong foundations in customer service, O365, Google Workspace, and Salesforce, I bring a comprehensive approach to IT solutions and end-user support. I’m passionate about leveraging technology to create efficient, user-friendly systems, and I strive to share knowledge by developing thorough documentation and training resources.

                    <p>10/2022 - Present</p>
                    <p>
                        As the primary contact for patient hardware support, I managed configurations and performance for over 800 Cradlepoint routers in patient homes, ensuring security and firmware updates were current. I collaborated closely with development and product teams to troubleshoot hardware issues, support R&D initiatives, and create comprehensive training materials for both internal and customer use. Additionally, I oversaw Depot standards, trained users on new equipment, coordinated supply chain and asset management, and routinely audited licensing to optimize resources and prevent unnecessary renewals.

                    <p>
                        I administered over 200 users, mailboxes, and shared drives in Google Workspace, managed 300+ Windows and Mac systems using Manage Engine Desktop Central and JAMF, and imaged and distributed laptops for new hires. Through hardware recovery efforts, I recouped over $75,000 in assets within one year. I also managed Jira and Confluence for project and support teams, authored 50+ documentation pieces for policies and procedures, sourced vendors for hardware lifecycle and software licensing, handled Salesforce access management and data tasks, and provided support for the company’s proprietary virtual campus application.

                            I managed LAN/WAN and server issues across 20+ customer network environments, administered identity and access management for various systems, and oversaw O365 licensing for over 1,000 users. Additionally, I configured Proofpoint and Barracuda email security to mitigate spam and threats, implemented changes on Meraki and Cisco network devices, and optimized virtual desktops in VMware and Citrix. Throughout, I provided white-glove customer service to users across multiple industries.
